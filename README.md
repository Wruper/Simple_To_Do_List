# Simple_To_Do_List
An Android app that helps to sort and organize daily tasks.

## Background
This app was already made and published in "Google Play Store" in August 2021, but sadly when trying to update the app, I forgot the App Key in order to update the app.
Instead I had to create a new app and make a reprository in Github.

## Why was this app created?
The app was created for training porpuses. The main idea was to try an create an app that people could use, so that I could post the app in the Google Play store
in order to get familiar with app creation and publishing. As well as trying to learn new stuff about android and android development in general.

## What does the app do?
This app is a basic To-Do app, that allows the End-user to navigate, sort and follow their created tasks for the day. The app allows the End-user to set a reminder
that will alarm the user about an upcoming task.

## What was used?
For the creation of the app every imaginable resource was used: Stackoverflow, Youtube tutorials and other coding websites

## Google Play Store listing
The app can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wruper.simple_to_do_list
